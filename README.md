# Remote_SSHFS
While working on AIX I found it little hard and frustrating to edit and view the code on vim as it is a legacy software there is still time on it for newovim and other better softwares, like 
Remote-SSH by vscode

## Solution
So I thought if Remote-SSH not there than it is better I create an extension for just editing the files which I can do while mounting the file system of server on my storage temporarily and then work on it and when not in use just demount it again.
Hence this extension of Vscode for working on OS servers which currently do not support Remote-SSH.
